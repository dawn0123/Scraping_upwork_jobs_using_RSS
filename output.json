My name is Ghaith, and I am a data scientist in a fintech company. We are currently facing challenges in our prediction process for a class-based problem and are seeking expert consultancy to overcome these obstacles. <br /><br />\nProblem Description<br /><br />\nWe are working on a class-based prediction problem where we aim to predict customer credit risk statuses. Our dataset consists of customers&rsquo; financial and demographic information. The ultimate goal is to build an accurate prediction model that can effectively classify customer credit risk statuses into their respective classes. We have 9 different class value to show customers&rsquo; statuses and these classes are ranked from 1(the worst status) to 9(the best status). <br /><br />\nAbout Dataset<br /><br />\nWe have customer demographic information like age, city, income, working status, etc. and financial information like total debt, payment behavior, type of credit customer has, etc. Our dataset might include different rows of a unique customers in a different point of time. The data is labeled with 9 classes as mentioned above.<br /><br />\nCustomer A gets 4 different predictions in different time points. <br />\nCustomer B gets 1 different prediction in a specific time.<br />\nCustomer C gets 2 different predictions in&nbsp;&nbsp;different time points.<br /><br />\nAccording to information above, our model should recognize if a person has a previous record or not. There is no certain sequences for returning customers, customers might get their information in different time intervals.<br /><br />\nPrevious Attempts<br /><br />\nOver the past few months, we have made significant efforts to tackle this prediction problem. <br /><br />\nWe have tried different perspective to analyze data,<br /><br />\nObserving commonality between same risk classes,<br />\nML model interpretability approaches<br /><br />\nWe have experimented with a variety of preprocessing techniques, such as<br /><br />\nImbalance dataset techniques (SMOTE, data augmentation),<br />\nDimension reduction,<br />\nData transformation,<br />\nTypical cleaning and data preprocessing approaches<br /><br />\nWe have explored various machine learning algorithms, including<br /><br />\nTree based algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost),<br />\nNN Networks<br /><br /><br />\nCurrent Challenges<br /><br />\nWe have one tree-based ml model. We are trying to increase the accuracy in all classes. Our accuracy, f1 score, precision and recall metrics are around 0.73 and this is the average result for evaluation metrics. We have lower accuracy in minority classes since we have 9 different classes and our data is imbalance. Furthermore, our data includes both returning and not-returning customers and model predictions are not stabile for the returning users. For example, if we predicted someone&rsquo;s score last week as 5 out of 9, today if same user comes back again, the prediction might vary from the previous prediction. The changes in values of features between the two records might not be significant yet the the model prediction can be different.<br /><br /><br />\nDesired Consultancy<br /><br />\nGiven the challenges we are facing, we are seeking consultancy services from an experienced data scientist like yourself. We believe your expertise and insights could greatly assist us in overcoming these obstacles and achieving better predictive performance. Specifically, we are looking for someone to take a deeper look at out training process and advise us on how we optimize the whole pipelines. <br /><br /><br />\nWe would appreciate it if you could provide us with your availability for a consultation meeting or call. We anticipate the consultancy process to span approximately [duration, e.g., 1-2 weeks up to 4 weeks]. We are flexible with the timing and can adjust our schedules accordingly.<br />\nPlease let us know about your availability, consulting rates, and any further information you require from our end to proceed. We are eager to work with you and confident that your expertise will prove invaluable in overcoming our prediction obstacles.<br />\nThank you for your time and consideration. <br /><br />\nWe look forward to your favorable response.<br />\nSincerely,<br /><br />\nGhaith<br /><br />","budget":"","hourly":"$40.00-$70.00","postOn":1689854381000,"category":"Machine Learning","skills":["Machine Learning","Data Science","Deep Learning","Data Modeling","Credit Scoring"],"country":"Turkey","unread":true},{"title":"Google ML Kit (Object Detection Custom Model) Deploy with Flutter Using Firebase - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Google-Kit-Object-Detection-Custom-Model-Deploy-with-Flutter-Using-Firebase_%7E01654f26b7ce78307c","link":"%7E01654f26b7ce78307c","content":"We are Developing the AI-Based Mobile Application in Flutter. and we had created a Machine Learning Model for the App, but we are facing an issue with the Object Detection Model which is built on Yolov5, and wants to Deployment in iOS Application (Flutter).<br /><br />\nwe are using Google ML Kit with Flutter and Firebase. so If you have Expertise in the Deployment of the Yolo Model with the Flutter App for iOS then Please Apply.<br /><br />\nMore detail we will share in Message.<br /><br />\nThank you<br /><br />","budget":"$500","hourly":"","postOn":1689851940000,"category":"Mobile App Development","skills":["Flutter","Hybrid App Development","Firebase","Machine Learning","iOS","Machine Learning Model","YOLO","Object Detection"],"country":"India","unread":true},{"title":" Ai Midjourney specialist - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Midjourney-specialist_%7E015c0c5a4f71478388","link":"%7E015c0c5a4f71478388","content":"Looking for a midjourney specialist who can assist us with our upcoming Ai projects that involve creatives and text to image.<br /><br />","budget":"","hourly":"$25.00-$50.00","postOn":1689851391000,"category":"Machine Learning","skills":["Artificial Intelligence","Machine Learning","Midjourney AI"],"country":"United Arab Emirates","unread":true},{"title":"% Partnership in an Automation agency for business - Automation and AI Solutions Architect - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Partnership-Automation-agency-for-business-Automation-and-Solutions-Architect_%7E019791d739b559c639","link":"%7E019791d739b559c639","content":" I hope you&#039;re doing well.

This platform will allow influencers to monetize their follower base through subscriptions and affiliates to earn income by promoting these influencers.<br /><br />\n## Essential Concepts<br /><br />\n### Twitter API<br />\nTwitter API allows developers to interact with Twitter&#039;s functionality programmatically, which includes actions such as retrieving tweets, creating new tweets, or tracking followers. In this project, Twitter API will play a pivotal role in obtaining data related to influencers and their followers. Familiarizing yourself with Twitter API documentation and concepts such as rate limiting, authentication, and the different types of endpoints will be crucial.<br /><br />\n### Affiliate Marketing<br />\nAffiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing strategy where an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person&#039;s or company&#039;s products. In our scenario, our affiliates will earn a commission for every follower they bring who subscribes to the influencer&#039;s content. Understanding the various commission structures, tracking mechanisms, and promotional strategies used in affiliate marketing will be beneficial.<br /><br />\n### Stripe API<br />\nStripe provides an extensive suite of APIs that allows businesses to handle online transactions. For our application, Stripe will be used to manage subscription payments, process payments, and distribute the earnings to influencers and affiliates. The ability to set up payment processing, handle payouts, and understand transaction metadata will be vital.<br /><br />\n## Milestone 1: Basic Functionality<br /><br />\n### User Registration &amp;amp; Account Creation<br />\nDevelop a secure registration system using best practices for storing sensitive information. This system should incorporate form validation to ensure the integrity of the data. Once registered, users should be directed to their dashboard that displays crucial account information like their balance, total subscribers, and total affiliates.<br /><br />\n### Affiliate URL Generation<br />\nWhen a user registers as an affiliate, the system should automatically generate a unique URL for them. This URL will be used to track the subscribers they bring in. Affiliates should be able to access this URL easily from their dashboard.<br /><br />\n### Follower Tracking and Data Extraction<br />\nIncorporate the Twitter API to track followers. This will require understanding RESTful API principles and OAuth authentication. Also, you might need to employ web scraping techniques if the API does not provide all the necessary data.<br /><br />\n### Subscription Verification<br />\nEnsure that the system regularly verifies new followers who have been following the influencer for at least 30 days. This process helps authenticate genuine followers and aids in accurate commission calculation.<br /><br />\n### Payment Distribution<br />\nDesign a system that can calculate commissions and disburse payments to affiliates via their Stripe-connected accounts. Implement error handling for cases where a payment fails.<br /><br />\n## Milestone 2: Enhanced User Experience<br /><br />\n### Analytics Dashboard<br />\nUpgrade the dashboard to provide more detailed analytics. Incorporate visual aids like charts and graphs to help users understand their performance better. Display a log of payments made and received for transparency.<br /><br />\n### Intuitive User Interface<br />\nImprove the platform&#039;s user interface by focusing on user-friendly design principles. The design should be intuitive, and users should be able to find what they need quickly. Make sure to test the design with users and incorporate their feedback.<br /><br />\n### Subscription Management<br />\nBuild a feature that allows users to manage their followers&#039; subscriptions, such as pausing, canceling, or renewing subscriptions.<br /><br />\n## Milestone 3: Automation and Support<br /><br />\n### Automated Support and FAQs<br />\nCreate a chatbot that can answer common user queries. Additionally, develop an FAQ section that users can refer to for general information or troubleshooting steps. Use machine learning techniques to improve the chatbot&#039;s responses over time.<br /><br />\n### Email Notifications<br />\nImplement a system to automatically send email notifications about significant updates, changes in terms of service, or subscription updates.<br /><br />\n## Milestone 4: Advanced Features<br /><br />\n### Advanced Analytics and AI Insights<br />\nCreate a sophisticated analytics system that uses machine learning techniques to provide AI-generated insights. This could involve processing large volumes of data and providing predictions or suggestions to help users optimize their strategy.<br /><br />\n## Design Principles<br />\nAdopt a modern, minimalist design aesthetic that prioritizes user experience. The platform should be responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually pleasing. Consistency in design elements such as color schemes, fonts, and iconography is crucial.<br /><br />","budget":"$500","hourly":"","postOn":1689377129000,"category":"Full Stack Development","skills":["Dart","Flutter"],"country":"United States","unread":true},{"title":"AI - Clothing Detection - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Clothing-Detection_%7E01bbcfd1f259a2d31c","link":"%7E01bbcfd1f259a2d31c","content":"I need an application that uses deep/machine learning to detect clothing in an image.<br />\nSpecifically I need to be able to feed an image have it return to me the following:<br /><br />\n1.

Nevertheless, here&rsquo;s my goal: <br /><br />\nI am trying to train a 3D CNN with PyTorch on 3D medical imaging data. I have the code written to read the medical imaging file, process it, and convert into a multidimensional tensor to be fed into the model in a batch size of 1. The reason for the small batch size is essentially the model takes too much memory. And here is my main issue I am trying to solve: memory. <br /><br />\nI try to run the model on my MacBook Pro M1 Max 64gb of ram and it is not enough ram. So I tried running it on an 80gb ram NVIDIA GPU. Not enough. I don&rsquo;t exactly understand what is causing my model to use so much memory. I tried all kinds of techniques to reduce the memory and keep the model running on one processor - I changed the data type, I implemented compressed convolutional layers, tried storing my data in 6 bits per value, tried using Huffman coding, etc all these things to reduce memory usage at the cost of more computational time. None worked. I may just be missing something as I am not an expert in PyTorch. <br /><br />\nSo my latest approach is to run the model and explicitly spread each layer over different GPUs to reduce memory usage. I just want some help optimizing my model to implement memory reduction techniques, getting my model to run, and maybe some suggestions to what techniques are best for working with this type of medical data if you have any suggestions to test out.

With the exponential growth in generative AI and other ML capabilities, we&rsquo;d like to revisit those efforts. <br /><br />\nBROAD OBJECTIVES<br />\nThere are several areas we have been looking at, including:<br />\n1. Using AI/ML to replicate, simplify, or enhance our existing business processes or output quality. Examples include:<br />\n- Generating book summaries (text). We&rsquo;ve already tested ChatGPT4, hugging face, etc. The quality if very far from the the details and accuracy we require, so we&#039;re only using for reference at this point to supplement human writing.<br />\n- Generating the first cut of our book summary infographics (again, our infographics are extremely detailed to capture an entire book and existing AI capabilities seem limited). Still infographics generators come close<br />\n- Generating blog, email, social media content etc. using a mix of our existing content + third party content (we&rsquo;re already doing this but may not be fully leveraging the capabilities, especially the combination of text + graphics).<br />\n- Create &amp;quot;content nuggets&amp;quot; (text + graphics) using our own summaries and infographics&ndash;this is tied to (2) below<br /><br />\n2. Leverage on our existing content (and potentially tap on external content) to create derivative products/services that can generate extra revenue streams and/or improve value to customers. Here are some examples of ideas (generated through chatgpt4) which we think are interesting. The question will be: which ones are the most viable and how can we prototype and test the concept quickly? <br />\n- Customized Learning Paths: Use ML to understand the learning needs and preferences of each user. Create a customized learning path that combines summaries from various books..<br />\n- Cross-Referenced Summaries: Create a system that can identify related concepts across different book summaries. This will allow users to see different perspectives and ideas about the same topic from various authors.<br />\n- Interactive Summaries: Develop an interactive AI tool where users can ask questions and the system would pull relevant information from different book summaries. <br />\n- Problem-Solving Guides: Compile a series of book summaries that are focused on solving specific problems or achieving specific goals, like &amp;quot;how to start a new business&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how to learn faster&amp;quot;.<br />\n- Personalized Recommendations: Use AI algorithms to understand users&#039; reading habits and preferences, then recommend them relevant summaries. This could be based on their reading history, the ratings they&#039;ve given to previously read summaries, or their interaction with the content.<br />\n- Trend Analysis and Predictive Summaries: Analyze reading trends among your users to anticipate what topics or books they might be interested in the future. Provide them with summaries of upcoming books or trending topics.<br />\n- AI-powered Flashcards: Create AI-generated flashcards for each summary to reinforce the key takeaways. These flashcards could adapt to each user&#039;s understanding and recall ability, focusing on concepts they struggle with and repeating them at optimal intervals for efficient learning.<br />\n- Deep-Dive Summaries: Use AI to create &#039;deep-dive&#039; sections in your summaries, pulling in extra information on a topic from multiple books, and summarizing it further. This will provide users who want more in-depth knowledge with the extra detail they&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />\n3. Other forms of web experience personalization and enhancement (ranging from gathering feedback to providing on-demand answers to product recommendations). We tried a few existing vendors (e.g. Pure Clarity and Personyze) a few years back but the solutions weren&#039;t that great. Not sure if there are better solutions out there for our business.<br /><br />\n4. Identify book categories and keywords for each title to help us with tagging (UX + content management purposes) + SEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started using ChatGPT 4 to develop a first cut, but not sure if there are much better ways to it (e.g. auto-tagging?)<br /><br />\nPROJECT SCOPE<br />\nSuggest to move in 2 phases<br />\n1. Obviously we can&rsquo;t go into everything above. So we will probably start with a consultancy to lay out the considerations, strategy and approach. Possibly identify a few low-lying fruits that can be achieved easily with our existing content and current AI/ML capabilities. Then map out a prioritized plan of sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Suggest a budget of $250-500? This is an arbitrary number as we have no idea what&rsquo;s involved here. Please feel free to counter-propose (but kindly explain what&rsquo;s included in the scope)]<br /><br />\n2. Move into execution, including concept development, prototyping, user feedback etc. We have a really lean team, so ideally the bulk of the process can be handled by AI to keep things manageable. [The budget for this will depend a lot on what&rsquo;s decided&nbsp;&nbsp;in (1), we can confirm this later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />","budget":"$1,000","hourly":"","postOn":1688399813000,"category":"Generative AI","skills":["AI Content Creation","AI Text-to-Image","AI Chatbot","ChatGPT","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Natural Language Processing"],"country":"Singapore","unread":true},{"title":"AI GPT Personal Assistant - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/GPT-Personal-Assistant_%7E010b5fbfbe47225471","link":"%7E010b5fbfbe47225471","content":"Hello,<br />\nI need a personal chatbot to evaluate my PDFs, Google Drive, and Txt files.

Group one will follow a particular confirmation process, while group two will have a different approach for trade submissionGroup one and 2 have 3 sub groups. Once the bot identifies a suitable entry in the TradingView chart, it should rapidly submit the order to MetaTrader 4, including buy or sell, stop loss, and take profit levels. It should also be capable of closing trades if they are no longer favorable before entering them.<br /><br />\nTo facilitate communication, the bot needs to create web hooks, enabling it to send notifications to me via email, text, or an app. The notifications should include information such as the entry point, stop loss, take profit, and the specific method used to enter the trade<br /><br />\nAn important aspect is the selection criteria for trades, as I focus on specific market points that generate approximately 2 to 3 trades daily.

Task:<br />\nWe need a WAY to find a set of Ks, Ps to undistort a barrel distorted image (attached) from a security ip-camera using OpenCV undistort().<br />\nhttps://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga69f2545a8b62a6b0fc2ee060dc30559d<br /><br />\nThe undistorted image should be straight like in google street view, except vertical perspective.<br /><br />\n*. Please pay attention in the attached image to the horizontal curved top row of cars - that we can&#039;t make straight (Cam-17.Med.Line.png).<br /><br />\n==================================================<br />\n*. We use OpenCV undistort() manually because we can&#039;t calibrate the camera with a chessboard.<br /><br />\n*. But you can suggest an alternative solution - how to convert a pixel from a OUR barrel distorted image to geo coordinate.<br />\n==================================================<br /><br /><br /><br />\n2. Purpose:<br />\nWe need to project a pixel (x,y) from a barrel distorted image from a security ip-camera into a geo coordinate (latitude, longitude).<br />\n-. Example: Pixel (200, 300) is projected into geo coordinate (36.14588812, -115.24322812) .<br /><br />\nFor this purpose we need to find the Ks, Ps which undistort the barrel distorted image into a straight image.<br /><br />\nThe part we don&#039;t know how to do is - how to find the set of Ks, Ps - which will make the image straight.<br /><br />\nWe have (attached) a demo app with C# and C++ source code, that loads our distorted image, and lets user play with the Ks, Ps to see how they affect the image.<br />\nYou can try that app - to see if you can find the Ks, Ps to make the image straight.<br /><br />\n==================================================<br />\n*. We use OpenCV undistort() manually because we can&#039;t calibrate the camera with a chessboard.<br /><br />\n*. But you can suggest an alternative solution - how to convert a pixel from a OUR barrel distorted image to geo coordinate.<br />\n==================================================<br /><br /><br /><br />\n3. Use-Case Story:<br />\n*. The security ip-camera resolution is D1 (720x480).<br />\n*. The camera view is perspective, looking at a flat parking lot.<br />\n*. The parking lot is usually a big square area of 200 meters by 200 meters.<br />\n*. We usually have about 30 cameras to cover the area.<br />\n*. The altitude of the coordinate of the detected object is not important and can be considered as zero.<br />\n*. The projection needs to take into consideration the barrel distortion of the camera.<br />\n*. The accuracy needed is flexible - about 1 square meter, but still - it needs to take into consideration the barrel distortion of the camera.<br />\n*. We don&#039;t need to provide geo coordinate for points that are too far away from the camera, because that area will be covered by a different camera closer to that area.<br /><br /><br /><br />\n4. Additional Details:<br />\n*. How to Run the Demo App:<br />\n-. You can run the ./GeoCameraUI/bin/Debug/GeoCameraUI.exe on a Windows machine. Or you can open it in Visual Studio and run it from there.<br />\n-. If you change and recompile c++ - copy the c++ dll into c# output folder.<br /><br />\n*. The environment is Windows 10 64 bit.<br /><br />\n*. The camera of the attached image (Cam-17) is Dahua N43AB52.<br /><br />\n*. Flexible hours (you can work whenever you want).<br />\n*. No rush or pressure.<br />\n*. Warm support throughout the project.<br /><br /><br /><br />\n5. Attached:<br />\n*. GeoCamJ.7z - C# App with source code.<br />\n*.

Capture or Generate Depth Maps: Depth maps provide information about the distance of objects from the camera. They can be obtained using specialized depth-sensing cameras or generated through depth estimation algorithms applied to stereo images or other techniques. Each frame of the 3D video is associated with a corresponding depth map.<br /><br />\n2. Convert 3D Video to Equirectangular Format: The 3D video is typically captured using a multi-camera setup or generated using computer graphics techniques. It consists of multiple perspectives of the scene. To create a 360 VR video, these perspectives need to be transformed into an equirectangular format, which is a 2D representation of the entire spherical view.<br /><br />\n3. Depth Map Projection: The depth maps are projected onto the equirectangular image to provide depth information for each pixel. This can be achieved by warping the depth map to match the corresponding perspective in the equirectangular frame.<br /><br />\n4. Depth-Based Rendering: With the depth maps projected onto the equirectangular image, a process called depth-based rendering is performed. This involves rendering the scene from different perspectives based on the depth information to create a coherent 3D representation. The depth information helps determine which objects should appear closer or farther away, providing depth perception to viewers.<br /><br />\n5. Stitching and Blending: Once the depth-based rendering is performed, the individual frames of the equirectangular video need to be stitched together seamlessly to form a continuous 360 VR video. Additionally, blending techniques are applied to smooth out any visual artifacts or seams caused by the stitching process.<br /><br />\n6. Encoding and Playback: The final 360 VR video is encoded using specific codecs and formats suitable for VR playback. Popular formats include equirectangular projection in MPEG-4 (e.g., .mp4) or VP9 (e.g., .webm) format. The encoded video can then be played back on VR devices or platforms that support 360-degree video playback.<br /><br />\nIt&#039;s important to note that creating a high-quality 360 VR video involves several technical challenges, including accurate depth map estimation, precise depth map projection, seamless stitching, and rendering artifacts minimization. Advanced computer vision and video processing techniques are often employed to achieve the desired results.<br /><br />","budget":"$6,098","hourly":"","postOn":1687882110000,"category":"Deep Learning","skills":["Computer Vision","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Deep Learning","OpenCV","Neural Network","Unreal Engine","Unity","Blender"],"country":"India","unread":true},{"title":"Looking for a data scientist to join our project - Upwork","jobURL":"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Looking-for-data-scientist-join-our-project_%7E013aec2a1e284cbcfd","link":"%7E013aec2a1e284cbcfd","content":"We are looking for a skilled individual to join our project as a data scientist for a period of 3 to 6 months.

Animals, plants, inanimate objects, even people &mdash; we&rsquo;re all made of atoms that are in a constant state of vibration. Everything that vibrates has its own defined frequency, and when particular cells of the human body vibrate outside of their frequency, illness can occur. Vibrational Healing, also known as Energy Healing, is an evolving field centered around the concept that the body is more than the sum of its individual parts. There are other forces at play that cannot yet be precisely measured &mdash; chiefly among them the forces that animate us and give us consciousness. <br /><br />\nOften thought of as energy fields, these forces interact with us on a cellular level to provide the various complex systems that constitute our physical makeup. Vibrational Healing focuses on exposing dysfunctional or damaged cells to their normal healthy frequency. By doing so, a remarkable degree of healing can occur &mdash; similar to the synchronization of two out-of-sync metronomes coupled together.

ZOOM MEETING&#039;S WILL BE HELD FOR AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES (potential full-time position depending on commitment)<br /><br /><br />\nWe are seeking talented and experienced professionals to join our team and contribute to the development of Notely, an innovative AI-powered note generation platform tailored for medical students and later on for all tertiary education type of students. The goal of this project is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers key features and functionalities to revolutionise the learning experience for medical students.<br /><br />\nNotely &amp;quot;Unique Learning Model&amp;quot;: <br />\nNotely employs a unique learning model that sets it apart from traditional note-taking platforms. Our platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, personalized study techniques, and a comprehensive knowledge database to deliver a truly transformative learning experience for students.<br /><br />\n[AI NOTE GENERATION]<br />\nNotely utilizes advanced AI algorithms to analyze lecture recordings, video content, and PDF materials uploaded by students. Through machine learning, the platform automatically transcribes and extracts key concepts, generating comprehensive and well-structured notes. This AI-powered note generation eliminates the need for manual transcription and streamlines the note-taking process. Additionally, Notely incorporates the use of renowned study techniques like the Feynman Technique and Leitner System to enhance the note generation process. These techniques help students simplify complex topics and reinforce their understanding through active recall and spaced repetition.<br /><br />\n[Personalised Study Techniques]<br />\nWe understand that medical students have different learning preferences and needs. Notely will offer personalised study techniques tailored to individual subjects and learning styles. By leveraging techniques like the Feynman Technique, students can break down complex medical concepts into simple explanations, promoting a deeper understanding. The Leitner System, on the other hand, facilitates spaced repetition, ensuring optimal knowledge retention over time. Notely adapts these techniques based on each student&#039;s preferences, enabling them to study in a way that suits their unique learning style.<br /><br />\n[Integration with Comprehensive Knowledge Database]<br />\nNotely goes beyond note generation by integrating a comprehensive knowledge database that encompasses textbooks, research articles, diagrams, and relevant images specific to medical subjects. This integration allows Notely to expand on the personalized notes generated for each student. By linking the generated notes with additional information from the knowledge database, Notely provides students with a holistic understanding of the topics covered. This integration enhances comprehension, supports independent exploration, and encourages a deeper engagement with the subject matter.<br /><br />\n[Personalised Notes]<br />\nNotely takes into account each student&#039;s individual work and progress to generate personalized notes. By analyzing the student&#039;s uploaded lecture recordings, video content, and other materials, Notely tailors the generated notes to match the student&#039;s specific learning needs. The integration with the general database further enriches the notes, providing additional insights and expanding on the topics covered. This personalized approach ensures that students receive notes that are highly relevant to their coursework and tailored to their individual learning journey.<br /><br />\nMVP Team requirement (only for medical students): <br /><br />\nAI Development:<br />\nWe are looking for an AI developer with expertise in natural language processing and machine learning algorithms.
